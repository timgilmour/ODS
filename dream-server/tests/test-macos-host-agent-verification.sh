# Regression: after launchctl bootstrap succeeds for dream-host-agent, the
# macOS installer MUST:
#   1. force the spawn with `launchctl kickstart -p` (bootstrap alone can leave
#      the service "pended speculative" under launchd throttling), AND
#   2. poll /health before printing the [OK] line, so we never report success
#      while the agent is actually down.
#
# Without both, dashboard-api hits "Host agent unreachable" on every model and
# extension action even though the installer reports success (observed on
# m5-mbp during the 2026-05-23 fleet test).
