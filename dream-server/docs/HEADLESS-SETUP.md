# Headless Setup and QR Onboarding

Dream Server can be prepared as a local AI appliance: install it on hardware,
ship or hand over the machine without a monitor, and let the recipient finish
setup from a phone, laptop, tablet, or TV browser.

This page is the hardware-neutral map of the code that makes that possible.
Strix Halo, DGX Spark, NUC-style mini PCs, repurposed desktops, and home lab
servers should all follow the same high-level flow once their platform-specific
installer path is working.

## Current Status

The headless setup stack is implemented on `main` across the setup-card script,
dashboard, dashboard API, host agent, mDNS announcer, AP-mode script, and Caddy
proxy extensions.

Status is **deployed in code and partially validated on the real hardware
fleet** for the LAN, mDNS, dashboard, magic-link, and Hermes access paths. The
packaged appliance handoff still needs per-image validation because routers,
Wi-Fi chipsets, AP-mode behavior, and client devices vary. In particular:

- Magic-link generation, QR rendering, first-run state, and dashboard flows have
  unit/integration coverage.
- Wi-Fi management is implemented for Linux hosts with NetworkManager / `nmcli`.
- AP mode is available but intentionally disabled by default because it takes
  over a wireless interface.
- mDNS plus `dream-proxy` provide the friendly LAN URLs. Fleet validation
  covers representative LAN behavior, but each packaged hardware image should
  still be validated on its target router/client environment.

## User Journey

1. The device is pre-installed with Dream Server and given a friendly
   `DREAM_DEVICE_NAME` such as `dream`, `studio`, or `kitchen-ai`.
2. The operator prints or ships a setup card with:
   - QR #1: a Wi-Fi QR code for the device setup AP, if AP mode is used;
   - QR #2: either the setup URL for first-run provisioning, or a permanent
     owner-card magic link that lands the new owner in Dream Talk.
3. The recipient scans the setup QR, opens the first-boot wizard, and joins the
   device to their home network when needed.
4. Dream Server generates an owner-card magic link and QR code for the first user.
5. After redemption, the user lands in Dream Talk, a mobile-first local chat
   portal backed by Hermes. Power users can still open the dashboard and the
   advanced Hermes surface for model, service, and diagnostics controls.

## Operator Prep Checklist

For a hardware image or pre-installed unit:

1. Install Dream Server normally for the target platform.
2. Set a unique `DREAM_DEVICE_NAME` in `.env`.
3. Set `DREAM_SESSION_SECRET` so magic-link redemption can issue signed
   `dream-session` cookies.
4. Enable the LAN entry path:
   - `dream-proxy` for friendly HTTP routing;
   - `dream-mdns` for local `.local` discovery where supported;
   - `hermes-proxy` if the Hermes Agent should be LAN-reachable behind auth.
5. For AP-based out-of-box setup, write `/etc/dream/ap-mode.conf`, install the
   `dream-ap-mode.service` unit, and generate a setup card or factory owner card.
6. Validate the exact QR flow on the target image before shipping.

## Validation Checklist

Use this checklist for each target hardware profile:

- Fresh install completes without a monitor attached.
- Setup card Wi-Fi QR joins the setup AP.
- Setup URL QR opens the first-boot wizard.
- Wi-Fi scan returns nearby networks on Linux NetworkManager hosts.
- Wi-Fi connect succeeds and the device remains reachable after network handoff.
- `dream-proxy` answers on port 80 from another device on the LAN.
- `<device>.local`, `chat.<device>.local`, `dashboard.<device>.local`, and
  `auth.<device>.local` resolve on at least one phone and one laptop.
- Owner-card magic link redeems repeatedly, sets the signed cookie, and redirects
  to Hermes until revoked.
- Temporary guest invite links still redeem, set the signed cookie, and redirect
  to their selected target.
- Hermes is reachable through `hermes.<device>.local` when enabled.
- Mobile voice is validated from HTTPS/Tailscale HTTPS when the packaged Hermes
  surface exposes microphone controls; plain HTTP is expected to show fallback
  readiness rather than promise mic access.
- Dashboard remains available for power users after first-run completion.

## Known Limits

- AP mode is Linux-only and assumes NetworkManager, `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`,
  `iptables`, and a Wi-Fi interface capable of AP mode.
- AP mode is disabled by default because it is intentionally disruptive to a
  wireless interface.
- mDNS behavior varies by client OS, router, VPN, and enterprise network policy.
- The complete AP-mode appliance handoff still needs repeated end-to-end
  testing on each target packaged hardware image.
- Owner cards are physical credentials. They are not device-bound in v1 and
  should be revoked if a card is lost, photographed, or replaced.
