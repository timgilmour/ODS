# Brave Search

Optional search service that wraps the Brave Search API behind a small, stable JSON HTTP endpoint.

## Why this exists

The default `searxng` extension is excellent and free, but its results come from upstream public engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.) that aggressively bot-block at small scale. If you self-host for more than a single user — or run automated agents that issue many queries — you will eventually hit captchas or rate limits that searxng cannot route around.

Brave Search runs its own independent crawler index. It is not a Google reseller and has no captcha layer. The trade-off: it is a paid API. The free Data tier is sufficient for individual use; heavier usage requires a subscription.

This extension does **not** replace `searxng`. It runs alongside it. Use whichever fits your workload.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | — (required) | Subscription token from Brave Search API |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_PORT` | `8585` | External port on the host |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_SEARXNG_COMPAT` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable the searxng-compatible `/search` route (see below) |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `8000` | Upstream request timeout (advanced) |

Set the key in `.env`:

```
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=<your-token>
```

The container will refuse to start without it.

## Enable

```bash
ods enable brave-search
ods start brave-search
```

## API

### `GET /v1/search?q=<query>&count=<n>`

| Param | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | — (required) | Search query |
| `count` | `5` | Max results, clamped to 1–20 |

Success response (`200`):

```json
{
  "query": "your query",
  "results": [
    { "title": "...", "url": "https://...", "snippet": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Error responses:

| Status | Body | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `{"error":"missing_query_param_q"}` | `q` not supplied |
| `502` | `{"error":"upstream_error","status":N}` | Brave returned non-2xx |
| `502` | `{"error":"upstream_unavailable"}` | Network, DNS, or TLS failure while contacting Brave |
| `502` | `{"error":"invalid_upstream_json"}` | Brave returned a 2xx response that was not valid JSON |
| `504` | `{"error":"upstream_timeout"}` | Brave did not respond within 8s |

### `GET /search?format=json&q=<query>` (searxng compatibility mode, opt-in)

Disabled by default (`404`). Enable it in `.env` and restart the service:

```
BRAVE_SEARCH_SEARXNG_COMPAT=1
```

The route returns a searxng-shaped JSON document, so Perplexica and other
consumers of the same fields can point their searxng URL at this service.
Only the Perplexica integration is covered by this extension's contract:

```json
{
  "query": "your query",
  "number_of_results": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "https://...",
      "title": "...",
      "content": "...",
      "engine": "brave",
      "engines": ["brave"],
      "positions": [1],
      "score": 1.0,
      "category": "general",
      "template": "default.html",
      "parsed_url": ["https", "example.com", "/path", "", "", ""],
      "publishedDate": null,
      "thumbnail": "https://..."
    }
  ],
  "answers": [],
  "corrections": [],
  "infoboxes": [],
  "suggestions": [],
  "unresponsive_engines": []
}
```

Parameters:

| Param | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `format` | Required. Only `json` is supported; anything else returns `400 unsupported_format` |
| `q` | Required. Missing returns `400 missing_query_param_q` |
| `pageno` | 1-based page (searxng semantics), mapped to Brave's 0-based offset, capped at page 10 |
| `categories` | Only `general` is servable. Other categories (`images`, `videos`, `news`, …) return empty results with an honest `unresponsive_engines` entry |
| `engines` | If specified and `brave` is not among them, returns empty results with `unresponsive_engines` entries — the requested engines don't exist here |
| `language`, `time_range`, `safesearch` | Accepted but ignored |

Fidelity limits (degraded but honest — fields Brave cannot supply are empty,
never fabricated):

- `suggestions`, `answers`, `corrections`, `infoboxes` are always empty arrays.
- `number_of_results` is always `0` (searxng's "no engine estimate" convention).
- `score` is synthesized from result order using searxng's single-engine formula (`1/position`).
- `publishedDate` is set from Brave's `page_age` when present, else `null`.
- Only web (`general`) results are served. Perplexica's image/video/academic
  focus modes will honestly return no results rather than mislabeled web hits.

Upstream failures follow searxng's engine-failure contract — HTTP `200` with
empty `results` and a reason in `unresponsive_engines` (e.g.
`[["brave", "too many requests"]]`, `[["brave", "timeout"]]`) — because that
is what searxng consumers already handle when an engine is throttled.
Requests with missing/invalid `q` or `format` still fail with `400`.

### Pointing Perplexica at Brave

With this service enabled and `BRAVE_SEARCH_SEARXNG_COMPAT=1`, set in `.env`:

```
PERPLEXICA_SEARXNG_API_URL=http://brave-search:8585
```

and run `ods restart perplexica`. ODS validates this explicit endpoint and reconciles
Perplexica's persisted setting after startup, so it also works on upgrades
where Perplexica already saved the old SearXNG URL. Web-focus research then
uses Brave's index.

The override remains authoritative while it is set. To switch back, set
`PERPLEXICA_SEARXNG_API_URL=http://searxng:8080`, run
`ods restart perplexica`, and then remove the override. An empty override
preserves Perplexica's current persisted setting.

Perplexica's image, video, and specialty focus modes (academic, Reddit, etc.)
request engines Brave cannot serve and will return empty results; keep the
default SearXNG URL if you rely on those.

### `GET /health`

Returns `{ "ok": true }`. Used by the dashboard healthcheck.

## What this is *not*

The default `/v1/search` surface is intentionally not searxng's API. The
opt-in compatibility mode above covers searxng consumers, but it serves a
single engine and only the `general` category — it is a pragmatic bridge, not
a full searxng replacement. This service exists for users and scripts that
want a small, stable search interface backed by an index that doesn't fall
over under load.
