"""Generate ``data/persona/SOUL.md`` from the static persona template plus a
detected snapshot of *this* ODS install — what GPU backend it has,
which model is loaded, which services are running, what URLs are reachable.

The goal is for ODS (the agent) to answer accurately when the operator
asks "what can you do here?" or "is comfyui running?" or "what model are you
using?" — instead of inventing capabilities it doesn't have, or denying
ones it does. The dynamic context block is bounded to a few hundred tokens
so it doesn't bloat Hermes's 16k-token system prompt.

Idempotent. Safe to re-run after enabling/disabling services. Designed to
be invoked from:

  * installer phase 11 (after services come up — so docker ps reports the
    real state, not the pre-launch one)
  * ``ods restart hermes`` (so the persona reflects current state on every
    container recreate)
  * the operator manually when they want to refresh

Reads only — never modifies SOUL.md.template, never touches anything other
than the output path.
