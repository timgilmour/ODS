# Model Management

ODS runs local language models as GGUF files from `data/models/`.
The recommended path is the Dashboard Models page. Manual model swaps are also
available for headless maintenance and advanced operator workflows.

## Recommended: Dashboard Models Page

Open the Dashboard and go to **Models**.

From there you can:

- See the curated ODS model catalog.
- Check approximate model size, VRAM requirement, context length, and specialty.
- Download a catalog model into `data/models/`.
- Load a downloaded model.
- Load a manually copied single-file GGUF discovered in `data/models/`.
- Delete a downloaded catalog model.

When a catalog model is loaded, ODS updates the active GGUF settings
and restarts the local inference service so OpenAI-compatible clients use the
new model. After the switch settles, verify it from the host:

```bash
ods model current
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

On macOS native Metal and Windows native/Lemonade installs, use
`http://localhost:8080/v1/models` unless you changed the port.

Downstream apps that talk directly to `llama-server` or LiteLLM pick up the
active model through those services. Examples include Open WebUI, Token Spy,
OpenCode, and OpenAI-compatible SDK clients configured against ODS.
Perplexica also stores a persisted `defaultChatModel`; installer first boot and
bootstrap hot-swap update it automatically, but after a manual model change you
should verify Perplexica settings or run `scripts/repair/repair-perplexica.sh`.

Hermes Agent keeps its own model name in `data/hermes/config.yaml`. If Hermes is
enabled after a model switch, verify the `model.default` line:

```bash
grep -n "default:" data/hermes/config.yaml
docker restart ods-hermes
```

For Lemonade/AMD backends, Hermes and LiteLLM may need the model name in the
form `extra.<GGUF_FILE>`.

## Where Models Live

Default model directory:

```bash
~/ods/data/models/
```

On Windows installs:

```powershell
$env:USERPROFILE\ods\data\models\
```

Each model is normally a single `.gguf` file:

```bash
ls -lh ~/ods/data/models/*.gguf
```

The active model is recorded in `.env`:

```bash
grep -E "^(LLM_MODEL|GGUF_FILE|CTX_SIZE|MAX_CONTEXT)=" ~/ods/.env
```

`GGUF_FILE` is the filename ODS should load from `data/models/`.
`LLM_MODEL` is the friendly logical model name used by scripts and config.
`CTX_SIZE` and `MAX_CONTEXT` control context length.

Hermes requires at least a 64K context window. Installer bootstrap mode uses
`65536` for the fast-start model, then switches `.env`, llama-server, and
Hermes config to the model selector's chosen full-model context when the
background download completes. Larger tiers may use `131072`; constrained tiers
can remain at a smaller selected context.

## Manual: Download a Catalog Model

For most users, use the Dashboard. If you are debugging a failed download or
preloading a machine, download the exact catalog GGUF URL from
`config/model-library.json` into `data/models/`.

Example:

```bash
cd ~/ods
mkdir -p data/models

curl -L \
  -o data/models/Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

Then open Dashboard -> Models. If the filename matches a catalog entry, the
model should appear as downloaded and you can load it from the Dashboard.

## Bring Your Own GGUF

For a single local `.gguf`, the normal flow is:

1. Copy the file into `data/models/`.
2. Open Dashboard -> Models.
3. Load the local entry.

The Dashboard updates `.env`, `config/llama-server/models.ini`, and the active
runtime routing before restarting the inference service.

On Lemonade installs, loading a model directly inside the Lemonade app only
changes Lemonade's current runtime state. It does not update ODS's
`.env` or LiteLLM routing. Open WebUI talks through ODS/LiteLLM, so
its next chat can ask for the persisted ODS model and Lemonade may
unload the model you opened manually. Use Dashboard -> Models -> Load when you
want Open WebUI and other ODS clients to keep using the local GGUF.

Use the manual procedure below only if you cannot access the Dashboard or need
to repair an install by hand.

1. Download the GGUF into `data/models/`.

```bash
cd ~/ods
mkdir -p data/models
cp /path/to/MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf data/models/
```

2. Update `.env`.

```bash
ods config edit
```

Set:

```dotenv
LLM_MODEL=my-model
GGUF_FILE=MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf
CTX_SIZE=8192
MAX_CONTEXT=8192
```

3. Update `config/llama-server/models.ini`.

```ini
[my-model]
filename = MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf
load-on-startup = true
n-ctx = 8192
```

4. If Hermes is enabled, update `data/hermes/config.yaml`.

```yaml
model:
  default: "MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf"
  context_length: 65536
```

For Lemonade/AMD backends, use:

```yaml
model:
  default: "extra.MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf"
  context_length: 65536
```

Also keep `auxiliary.compression.context_length` at the same value and use
`compression.threshold: 0.50`; older absolute-token thresholds can leave Hermes
waiting too long to compact.

5. For AMD/Lemonade installs, verify `config/litellm/lemonade.yaml`.

This file pins the model by name on both its `default` and `"*"` entries, and
LiteLLM is what every client talks to — if it still names the old GGUF, the swap
has not taken effect regardless of what `.env` says. Tier swaps via
`ods model swap` regenerate it and restart `ods-litellm` automatically; after a
manual `.env`/GGUF edit like this one, verify it yourself (re-run
`scripts/render-runtime-configs.py --surface litellm-lemonade` rather than
hand-editing).

Each local model alias should use the `extra.<GGUF_FILE>` form and should keep
Qwen3 thinking disabled for clients that do not pass that flag themselves:

```yaml
extra_body:
  chat_template_kwargs:
    enable_thinking: false
```

6. If Perplexica is enabled, reseed or verify its model setting.

```bash
LLM_MODEL="$(grep -E '^LLM_MODEL=' .env | tail -n1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"')"
PERPLEXICA_PORT="$(grep -E '^PERPLEXICA_PORT=' .env | tail -n1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"')"
scripts/repair/repair-perplexica.sh "http://127.0.0.1:${PERPLEXICA_PORT:-3004}" "$LLM_MODEL"
```

Bootstrap hot-swap handles this automatically. Manual GGUF edits and some
operator-driven switches should still be verified because Perplexica stores its
own app settings in its volume.

7. Restart the affected services.

```bash
ods restart llama-server
ods restart litellm
docker restart ods-hermes 2>/dev/null || true
```

If your install uses direct Docker Compose commands instead of the `ods` CLI,
recreate `llama-server` so it rereads `.env`.

## Verify a Switch

Use these checks after Dashboard or manual model changes:

```bash
ods model current
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

For LiteLLM installs that require an API key, use the key from `.env`:

```bash
LITELLM_KEY=$(grep '^LITELLM_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_KEY" http://localhost:4000/v1/models
```

From inside a Docker container, the inference endpoint is:

```text
http://llama-server:8080/v1
```

## Troubleshooting

### The download finished, but the model is not visible

Check the file is present and non-empty:

```bash
ls -lh data/models/*.gguf
```

If it is a catalog model, confirm the filename exactly matches
`config/model-library.json`. The Dashboard only marks catalog models as
downloaded when the on-disk filename matches the catalog entry.

### The model file exists, but loading fails

Check service logs:

```bash
ods logs llm
```

Common causes:

- The model needs more VRAM or unified memory than the machine has.
- Context length is too high; lower `CTX_SIZE` / `MAX_CONTEXT`.
- The GGUF is not compatible with the active backend.
- On AMD/Lemonade, a service is still asking for the raw filename instead of
  `extra.<GGUF_FILE>`.

### Open WebUI or another app still shows the old model

Verify the server first:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

If the server is correct, refresh the app. If the server is wrong, restart
`llama-server` and verify `.env` / `models.ini`.

On AMD/Lemonade installs, also check `config/litellm/lemonade.yaml`: clients go
through LiteLLM, which pins the model by name there. If it names the old GGUF,
regenerate it (a tier swap via `ods model swap` does this automatically) and
restart `ods-litellm`.

### Hermes still asks for the old model

Hermes has its own config:

```bash
grep -n "default:\|context_length:" data/hermes/config.yaml
docker restart ods-hermes
```

For AMD/Lemonade, use `extra.<GGUF_FILE>`.

## Current Limitations

- Dashboard model download and load are catalog-based.
- Custom GGUF import from a local file or arbitrary URL is not yet a first-class
  Dashboard workflow.
- `ods model swap` switches ODS tiers, not arbitrary GGUF files.
- `scripts/upgrade-model.sh` is a legacy helper for model-directory layouts and
  should not be used as the primary GGUF switch path on current installs.
