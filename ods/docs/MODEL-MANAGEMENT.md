# Model Management

ODS runs local language models as GGUF files from `data/models/`.
The recommended path is the Dashboard Models page. Manual model swaps are also
available for headless maintenance and advanced operator workflows.

## Recommended: Dashboard Models Page

Open the Dashboard and go to **Models**.

From there you can:

- See the curated ODS model catalog.
- Check approximate model size, VRAM requirement, context length, and specialty.
- Download a catalog model into `data/models/`.
- Load a downloaded model.
- Load a manually copied single-file GGUF discovered in `data/models/`.
- Delete a downloaded catalog model.

When a catalog model is loaded, ODS updates the active GGUF settings
and restarts the local inference service so OpenAI-compatible clients use the
new model. After the switch settles, verify it from the host:

```bash
ods model current
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

On macOS native Metal and Windows native/Lemonade installs, use
`http://localhost:8080/v1/models` unless you changed the port.

Dashboard activation and `ods model swap <tier>` use the same authenticated
host-agent transaction. The transaction updates `.env`, `models.ini`, the
native or container inference runtime, LiteLLM, Hermes, OpenClaw, OpenCode, and
Perplexica when those consumers are installed. It verifies the new runtime and
downstream routes before reporting success. A late failure restores the prior
files, runtime, and persisted app routes and then proves the previous model is
serving again.

Open WebUI, Token Spy, Privacy Shield, and OpenAI-compatible SDK clients follow
the stable ODS endpoint and do not persist a separate model route. Optional
apps that are not installed are skipped. Optional services that were stopped
remain stopped: persisted Hermes/OpenCode state and Compose environment are
updated without starting them, and Perplexica reconciles its app-owned state
from that environment the next time ODS starts it.

Direct edits to `.env`, `models.ini`, or app-owned settings bypass this
transaction. The Dashboard Settings editor therefore treats active model,
tier, artifact integrity, Lemonade identity, and runtime-profile fields as
read-only; use Model Manager instead. Use the manual procedure below only for
recovery or unsupported custom models, and verify every affected consumer
afterward.

## Where Models Live

Default model directory:

```bash
~/ods/data/models/
```

On Windows installs:

```powershell
$env:USERPROFILE\ods\data\models\
```

Each model is normally a single `.gguf` file:

```bash
ls -lh ~/ods/data/models/*.gguf
```

The active model is recorded in `.env`:

```bash
grep -E "^(LLM_MODEL|GGUF_FILE|CTX_SIZE|MAX_CONTEXT)=" ~/ods/.env
```

`GGUF_FILE` is the filename ODS should load from `data/models/`.
`LLM_MODEL` is the friendly logical model name used by scripts and config.
`CTX_SIZE` and `MAX_CONTEXT` control context length.

Hermes requires at least a 64K context window. Installer bootstrap mode uses
`65536` for the fast-start model, then switches `.env`, llama-server, and
Hermes config to the model selector's chosen full-model context when the
background download completes. Larger tiers may use `131072`; constrained tiers
can remain at a smaller selected context.

## Manual: Download a Catalog Model

For most users, use the Dashboard. If you are debugging a failed download or
preloading a machine, download the exact catalog GGUF URL from
`config/model-library.json` into `data/models/`.

Example:

```bash
cd ~/ods
mkdir -p data/models

curl -L \
  -o data/models/Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

Then open Dashboard -> Models. If the filename matches a catalog entry, the
model should appear as downloaded and you can load it from the Dashboard.

## Bring Your Own GGUF

For a single local `.gguf`, the normal flow is:

1. Copy the file into `data/models/`.
2. Open Dashboard -> Models.
3. Load the local entry.

The Dashboard updates `.env`, `config/llama-server/models.ini`, and the active
runtime routing before restarting the inference service.

On Lemonade installs, loading a model directly inside the Lemonade app only
changes Lemonade's current runtime state. It does not update ODS's
`.env` or LiteLLM routing. Open WebUI talks through ODS/LiteLLM, so
its next chat can ask for the persisted ODS model and Lemonade may
unload the model you opened manually. Use Dashboard -> Models -> Load when you
want Open WebUI and other ODS clients to keep using the local GGUF.

Use the manual procedure below only if you cannot access the Dashboard or need
to repair an install by hand.

1. Download the GGUF into `data/models/`.

```bash
cd ~/ods
mkdir -p data/models
cp /path/to/MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf data/models/
```

2. Update `.env`.

```bash
ods config edit
```

Set:

```dotenv
LLM_MODEL=my-model
GGUF_FILE=MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf
CTX_SIZE=8192
MAX_CONTEXT=8192
```

3. Update `config/llama-server/models.ini`.

```ini
[my-model]
filename = MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf
load-on-startup = true
n-ctx = 8192
```

4. If Hermes is enabled, update `data/hermes/config.yaml`.

```yaml
model:
  default: "MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf"
  context_length: 65536
```

For Lemonade/AMD backends, use:

```yaml
model:
  default: "extra.MyModel-Q4_K_M.gguf"
  context_length: 65536
```

Also keep `auxiliary.compression.context_length` at the same value and use
`compression.threshold: 0.50`; older absolute-token thresholds can leave Hermes
waiting too long to compact.

5. For AMD/Lemonade installs, verify `config/litellm/lemonade.yaml`.

Each local model alias should use the `extra.<GGUF_FILE>` form and should keep
Qwen3 thinking disabled for clients that do not pass that flag themselves:

```yaml
extra_body:
  chat_template_kwargs:
    enable_thinking: false
```

6. If Perplexica is enabled, reseed or verify its model setting.

```bash
LLM_MODEL="$(grep -E '^LLM_MODEL=' .env | tail -n1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"')"
PERPLEXICA_PORT="$(grep -E '^PERPLEXICA_PORT=' .env | tail -n1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"')"
scripts/repair/repair-perplexica.sh "http://127.0.0.1:${PERPLEXICA_PORT:-3004}" "$LLM_MODEL"
```

Dashboard activation and `ods model swap` handle this automatically. Raw GGUF
or `.env` edits still require verification because Perplexica stores its own app
settings in its volume.

7. Restart the affected services.

```bash
ods restart llama-server
ods restart litellm
docker restart ods-hermes 2>/dev/null || true
```

If your install uses direct Docker Compose commands instead of the `ods` CLI,
recreate `llama-server` so it rereads `.env`.

## Verify a Switch

Use these checks after Dashboard or manual model changes:

```bash
ods model current
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

For LiteLLM installs that require an API key, use the key from `.env`:

```bash
LITELLM_KEY=$(grep '^LITELLM_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_KEY" http://localhost:4000/v1/models
```

From inside a Docker container, the inference endpoint is:

```text
http://llama-server:8080/v1
```

## Troubleshooting

### The download finished, but the model is not visible

Check the file is present and non-empty:

```bash
ls -lh data/models/*.gguf
```

If it is a catalog model, confirm the filename exactly matches
`config/model-library.json`. The Dashboard only marks catalog models as
downloaded when the on-disk filename matches the catalog entry.

### The model file exists, but loading fails

Check service logs:

```bash
ods logs llm
```

Common causes:

- The model needs more VRAM or unified memory than the machine has.
- Context length is too high; lower `CTX_SIZE` / `MAX_CONTEXT`.
- The GGUF is not compatible with the active backend.
- On AMD/Lemonade, a service is still asking for the raw filename instead of
  `extra.<GGUF_FILE>`.

### Open WebUI or another app still shows the old model

Verify the server first:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
```

If the server is correct, refresh the app. If the server is wrong, restart
`llama-server` and verify `.env` / `models.ini`.

### Hermes still asks for the old model

Hermes has its own config:

```bash
grep -n "default:\|context_length:" data/hermes/config.yaml
docker restart ods-hermes
```

For AMD/Lemonade, use `extra.<GGUF_FILE>`.

## Current Limitations

- Dashboard model download and load are catalog-based.
- Custom GGUF import from a local file or arbitrary URL is not yet a first-class
  Dashboard workflow.
- `ods model swap` switches ODS tiers, not arbitrary GGUF files.
- Windows `ods.ps1 model swap` parity is tracked separately; use the Dashboard
  Models page for transactional activation on Windows until that command lands.
- `scripts/upgrade-model.sh` is a legacy helper for model-directory layouts and
  should not be used as the primary GGUF switch path on current installs.
