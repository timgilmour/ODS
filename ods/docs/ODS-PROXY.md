# ODS reverse proxy (`ods-proxy`)

The single LAN-facing entry that makes `http://<device>.local` (no port) actually work, with per-service subdomains for chat, dashboard, ODS Talk, auth, and hermes.

Without this extension, ODS's services bind to `127.0.0.1` by default — they're reachable from the host but not from another device on the LAN. A phone scanning a "browse to `http://ods.local`" QR code hits port 80 on the device, finds nothing, gives up. The dashboard's promise of `<device>.local` as a one-tap entry was broken before this extension.

With it, port 80 becomes the single entry point. Caddy answers each subdomain on the device's mDNS hostname and forwards to the right backend, **root-mounted** — no subpath gymnastics.

```
<device>.local           → 302 → chat.<device>.local
chat.<device>.local      → Open WebUI            (port 3000)
dashboard.<device>.local → ODS Dashboard       (port 3001)
talk.<device>.local      → ODS Talk mobile UI  (port 3001)
auth.<device>.local      → dashboard-api         (port 3002, magic-link redemption)
api.<device>.local       → dashboard-api         (port 3002, admin /api/*)
hermes.<device>.local    → hermes-proxy          (port 9120, when enabled)
/health                  → Caddy itself ("ok") — served on every host for easy probing
```

Each subdomain needs a LAN name record pointing at the ODS device. The companion `ods-mdns` service handles this automatically when enabled; until then, add equivalent DNS/hosts records for the subdomains you want to use. Other ODS services keep their loopback bindings. The proxy is the only thing that opens up to the LAN.

## Why host-based and not path-based

An earlier draft routed paths off the bare hostname (`<device>.local/chat`, `<device>.local/api/`, etc.). That broke because each backend was already coded to live at the root:

- Open WebUI's static assets and websocket endpoints assume root mounting; mounting under `/chat` produced broken root-relative paths and dead websockets.
- React Router base-href games would have been required for the dashboard.
- Open WebUI's OAuth callback URLs ignore proxy subpath rewriting and would have leaked back to the bare hostname.

Host-based routing sidesteps all of it. Every backend stays at `/`, the proxy just terminates the Host header.

## Cookie scope (and why this matters for magic links)

`dashboard-api` sets the `ods-session` cookie on `auth.<device>.local` during magic-link redemption with `Domain=<device>.local`. That makes the cookie visible to every subdomain: chat, hermes, dashboard, api. So a single redemption authenticates the user across all of them, even though each subdomain is a different origin.

The cookie's Domain is controlled by the `ODS_COOKIE_DOMAIN` env var in dashboard-api. Default empty (host-only); the installer sets it to `<device>.local` (the value of `ODS_DEVICE_NAME` + `.local`) so SSO works out of the box.

## When to enable it

- **Yes** if you want to reach ODS from a phone / laptop on the same network at `http://<device>.local`.
- **Yes** if you're using Tailscale (PR-12) — the proxy becomes the single endpoint exposed on the tailnet too.
- **No** if ODS is single-user / localhost-only — you save a small process and a port binding.

```bash
ods enable ods-proxy
# Test (substitute <device> with your ODS_DEVICE_NAME, default "ods"):
curl http://chat.<device>.local/         # → Open WebUI
curl http://dashboard.<device>.local/    # → ODS Dashboard
curl http://talk.<device>.local/talk     # -> ODS Talk
curl http://auth.<device>.local/health   # → ok (Caddy)
```

## Prerequisites

For the bare URL to actually load anything, two host-level conditions must hold:

1. **`ODS_PROXY_BIND=0.0.0.0`** in `.env`, or left unset so the proxy's default applies. The proxy listens on the LAN interface; with `ODS_PROXY_BIND=127.0.0.1`, the LAN can't reach it. Do not set global `BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` just for this — that exposes every service instead of only the proxy.
2. **mDNS, DNS, or hosts-file records publish the per-service subdomains.** The companion `ods-mdns` service handles this automatically when enabled; without it, create equivalent records manually.

The installer's first-boot flow handles both. If you're not using the installer, leave `ODS_PROXY_BIND` at its default or set it explicitly, then run `ods enable ods-proxy` manually.

## Security posture

**The proxy is the trusted gate.** Behind it, each service's own auth applies:

- `dashboard-api`: API key (`DASHBOARD_API_KEY`)
- Open WebUI: its own auth (`WEBUI_AUTH=true` by default — users sign up / sign in)
- Dashboard SPA: the React app shows admin features only when the API call succeeds
- ODS Talk: signed `ods-session` cookie from owner-card redemption; no dashboard admin API control
- `hermes-proxy`: Caddy `forward_auth` against `dashboard-api/api/auth/verify-session` (signed-cookie check)

The proxy itself adds NO auth layer. Adding one here would duplicate without strengthening.

**Trust model:**

- Trusted LAN: a home network where everyone on the network is in the household. Exposing the proxy on the LAN is fine.
- Tailscale: also fine — Tailscale's identity-based access is its own auth layer.
- Public internet: ❌ **NEVER**. Don't publish port 80 to the public internet without an additional auth/TLS layer.

## TLS

HTTP only in v1. Adding HTTPS needs one of:

1. **Tailscale-issued certs** — `tailscale cert <hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net` produces a real Let's-Encrypt cert; Caddy can serve it directly. Documented as a follow-up.
2. **Self-signed cert + device trust** — operator generates a cert, distributes the CA to family devices.
3. **Caddy's auto-https for public domains** — only works if you have a real DNS name. Not the `.local` case.

For now, plain HTTP on the trusted LAN. The cookie-issuing flows that set `Secure=` honor the request scheme — they'll set the Secure flag once TLS is in front.

## External reverse proxies

If you run ODS behind your own reverse proxy (Caddy Proxy Manager, Nginx
Proxy Manager, Traefik, Tailscale Funnel, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.), configure
the public browser URL for each service you expose. This is not
Proxmox-specific; Proxmox only hosts the VM.

```env
ODS_PUBLIC_URL=https://ods.example.com
ODS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_URLS={"open-webui":"https://chat.example.com","comfyui":"https://comfy.example.com","n8n":"https://n8n.example.com"}
ODS_TALK_PUBLIC_URL=https://talk.example.com
```

You can also use per-service env vars instead of the JSON map. The dashboard
checks these before falling back to `current-host:port` links:

```env
OPEN_WEBUI_PUBLIC_URL=https://chat.example.com
HERMES_PROXY_PUBLIC_URL=https://hermes.example.com
COMFYUI_PUBLIC_URL=https://comfy.example.com
N8N_PUBLIC_URL=https://n8n.example.com
WHISPER_PUBLIC_URL=https://whisper.example.com
TTS_PUBLIC_URL=https://tts.example.com
OPENCODE_PUBLIC_URL=https://code.example.com
```

Public URLs must be absolute `http://` or `https://` URLs. Invalid values are
ignored and the dashboard keeps the normal host/port fallback.

## How to bypass the proxy

`ods disable ods-proxy` stops the container. Each backend service goes back to being only reachable on its individual port (`<host-ip>:3000`, `<host-ip>:3001`, etc.) — and only if `BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` is set globally. Otherwise they stay loopback.

If you want LAN access to a single specific service without the proxy, add a `ports:` binding to that service's compose file (or set `BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` globally — but that exposes ALL services, the security tradeoff this whole extension was designed to avoid).
